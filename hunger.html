<p class= "para1">It is time to rethink how we grow, share and consume our food. If done right, agriculture, forestry and fisheries can provide nutritious food for all and generate decent incomes, while supporting people-centered rural development and protecting the environment. 
    Right now, our soils, freshwater, oceans, forests and biodiversity are being rapidly degraded.
     Climate change is putting even more pressure on the resources we depend on, increasing risks associated with disasters, such as droughts and floods.
      Many rural women and men can no longer make ends meet on their land, forcing them to migrate to cities in search of opportunities.

<p class= "para2">Poor food security is also causing millions of children to be stunted, or too short for the ages, due to severe malnutrition. 
    A profound change of the global food and agriculture system is needed if we are to nourish the 821 million people who are hungry today and the additional 2 billion people expected to be undernourished by 2050.
     Investments in agriculture are crucial to increasing the capacity for agricultural productivity and sustainable food production systems are necessary to help alleviate the perils of hunger.

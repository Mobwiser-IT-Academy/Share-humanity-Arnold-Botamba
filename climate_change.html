         <h2>DRC: At the bedside of Nyiragongo</h2>

<p class= "para1">The Congolese of the city of Goma in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were in fear during the night from Saturday to Sunday because the Nyiragongo volcano made a new eruption comparable to that of 1977 which had killed hundreds. 
  It is probably the lava lake of this stratovolcano which emptied through a crack. A flow reached the outskirts of Goma but apparently without causing direct victims.
</p>
        
<p class= "para2">The lava flow from the Nyiragongo volcano stopped 1.5 km from Goma airport on Sunday, May 23. The lava fire has also diminished considerably. The situation is stabilizing more and more, assured the scientific director of the Volcanological Observatory of Goma (OVG), Kasereka Mahinda, speaking in a special broadcast on the local RTNC at 5:00 am.

  Goma is safe unless there is another explosion along the cracks. The lava flow is already starting to cool down at Buhen√©.
 
  However, there is some lateral expansion of the lava flow in the built-up area in front of the airport. Earthquakes also continue, which implies the need for sustained vigilance.
